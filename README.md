# React Task Tracker

## Objective

Create a simple task tracker application using React. This application allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The purpose of this assignment is to evaluate the candidate's understanding of React components, state management, and basic interactivity.

## Requirements

- **Task List:** Display a list of tasks with their respective details (task name, date added, status).
- **Add Task:** Include a form or input field to add new tasks to the list. Tasks should have at least a name and a date added.
- **Delete Task:** Provide a way to delete tasks from the list.
- **Mark as Completed:** Allow users to mark tasks as completed. Completed tasks should be visually distinct from incomplete ones.
- **Styling:** Apply basic styling to make the interface user-friendly. Feel free to use any CSS frameworks or preprocessors if needed.
- **Responsiveness:** Ensure the application is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Local Storage:** Implement local storage to persist tasks even when the page is refreshed.
- **Filtering:** Add functionality to filter tasks based on their status (completed/incomplete).
- **Drag and Drop:** Implement drag-and-drop functionality to reorder tasks.
